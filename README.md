The Inventory Manager app is a simple application that is targeted to small businesses and individuals to help them in the management of their inventory. The main objectives of the app is to assist users in tracking and maintaining their stock, notifying the user via SMS when the stock is low, and making the experience straightforward. The app makes it easy for plain use through its simple and easy-to-use design.

Some important components of the application include the login page for the purpose of authentication, the inventory control page for managing the stock, and the notification system which sends SMS alerts when the stock is low. The help section contains the troubleshooting, frequently asked questions, and the ways to give principles feedback. The app's design follows a simple interface so that the user can easily find his/her way around. 
 
The app was developed with the help of Android Studio for at least API Level 24 (Android 7.0). It stores data in a database using SQLite and is developed using a modular approach and incremental testing. The strategies mentioned above ensured that the application worked as expected and that it was compatible with any Android device. The compatibility testing was conducted to check the application compatibility on different devices while the stress testing involved simulating large inventories to check the efficiency of the SMS alert system for low stock. This process was useful in detecting and solving issues that would have otherwise posed a risk to the appâ€™s stability. 
 
 A major issue I faced was how to implement the simplicity of the design while at the same time incorporating features that would be beneficial for the users. The app ultimately achieved a good balance of being secure yet easy to use. The most successful feature was the SMS notification system which is very effective and secure in notifying the user on low stock. The use of SQLite also demonstrated efficient data storage and management. 
 
The Inventory Manager app offers a basic yet helpful and intuitive approach to inventory management. It shows that the design is simple, yet it offers many features and is highly efficient, making it useful for small businesses as well as for individuals.
